        Many plants use the birds and the bees to move pollen from one flower to another, but sometimes this “simple act” is not so simple. Some plants have stepped up their sexual game and use explosions, entrapment, or deception to ensure the perpetuation of their species.   <br>   
        Learn about these and other amazing adaptations plants have developed to try and seal the deal. <br>
        Cuckoopint plants (Arum maculatum) also victimize their insect pollinators, but mostly by wasting their time. <br>
        The tiny flowers are borne in a column (called a spadix) with the female flowers at the bottom and the male flowers above them. The spadix is surrounded by a single petal-like appendage known as a spathe, which has hairlike structures on the inside, above the male flowers. Not only does this unusual flower structure emit a foul, fecal smell, but it also generates heat to attract a number of poo-loving insects. As they climb around on the slick spathe, they slide down into its interior and are kept from escaping by the hairs on the inside. <br>
        Eventually the hairs relax and the insects are able to escape past the male flowers, which cover them in pollen. <br>
        When the gullible insects fall again into other cuckoopints, their pollen-covered bodies rub against the female flowers at the bottom of the structure—pollinating them—and the cycle repeats itself.
