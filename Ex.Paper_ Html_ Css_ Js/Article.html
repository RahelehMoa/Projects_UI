    <p>Mouse over the DIV element and it will change, both in color and size!</p>

    <p>Click the "Try it" button and mouse over the DIV element again. The change will now happen gradually, like an
        animation:</p>

    <!-- <button onclick="myFunction()">Try it</button> -->

    <div id="show">
        <P>Fog computing is an emerging model, complementing the cloud computing platform, introduced to support the Internet of Things (IoT) processing requests at the edge of the network.</p> 
        <button onclick="myFunction()">Try it</button>
        <p>Smart-living IoT scenarios require the execution of multiple processing tasks at the edge of the network and leveraging on the Fog Computing approach results to be a worthwhile solution. </p>
        <p>Genetic Algorithms (GA) are a heuristic search and optimization class of techniques inspired by natural evolution. We propose two GA-based approaches for optimizing the processing task placement in a fog computing edge infrastructure aiming to support the Smart-living IoT nodes requests. The numerical results obtained in Matlab show that both GA-based approaches allow to maximize the covered areas while minimizing the resource wastage through the minimization of the overlapping areas.</p>
